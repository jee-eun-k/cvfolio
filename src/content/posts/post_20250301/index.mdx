## The Case of the Missing Page

As a frontend developer dipping my toes into DevOps, I encountered a puzzling scenario:

- ✅ Feature worked perfectly in development
- ✅ Local production builds worked fine
- ❌ Production deployment returned 404 errors

### Initial Investigation

1. **Verified the build**: Rebuilt locally - still working
2. **Checked server logs**: Requests weren't reaching Next.js server
3. **Suspected Nginx**: The common denominator between working/non-working environments

### The Root Cause

The issue stemmed from:

- Next.js route: `/pseudo-route`
- API endpoint: `/api/pseudo-route`

A security rule in Nginx was blocking both due to similar path patterns.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Problematic Nginx Configuration
```nginx
location pseudo-route/ {  # Overly broad match
   return 404;
}
```

### The Solution

1. Made the Nginx rule more specific:
```nginx
location = /api/pseudo-route {  # Exact match only
   # API-specific rules
}
```

2. Added proper routing for Next.js pages:
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://nextjs_server;
    # Other proxy settings...
}
```

## Key Takeaways

➡️ **Be specific** with Nginx location matching
➡️ **Test routing** in production-like environments
➡️ **Check proxy passes** when using application servers
➡️ **Document special routes** for future maintenance

This experience taught me the importance of understanding how frontend and infrastructure configurations interact in production environments.
