## The Great UI Framework Clash

As a frontend developer exploring modern UI libraries, I attempted to integrate both Material-UI (MUI) and shadcn/ui in a Next.js project. What followed was a deep dive into why these two libraries fundamentally don't play well together.

### The Fundamental Incompatibility

MUI and shadcn/ui take completely different approaches to styling:

- **MUI**: Uses CSS-in-JS (Emotion) with generated class names
- **shadcn/ui**: Uses Tailwind CSS with utility classes

Their styling systems conflict at the architectural level, making coexistence painful rather than productive.

### Attempted Solutions

1. **Wrapper Components**
   - Created isolated wrappers with CSS resets
   - Result: Temporary fixes that broke easily

2. **Manual !important Overrides**
   - Added ! to Tailwind classes (e.g., !border-red-800)
   - Result: Proved specificity issues but wasn't maintainable

3. **Tailwind important Config**
   - Set `important: true` in tailwind.config.js
   - Result: Failed due to fundamental CSS methodology differences

### Key Takeaways

➡️ **Don't mix them** unless absolutely necessary for specific components
➡️ Their styling architectures are fundamentally incompatible
➡️ Choose one approach (CSS-in-JS or utility classes) per project
➡️ If you must use both, isolate them completely in separate parts of your app

In the end, I realized that forcing these libraries to work together creates more problems than it solves. It's better to commit to one styling methodology per project for maintainability and consistency.
