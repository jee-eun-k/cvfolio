Bonus-Reconciliation Back Office Service Application Development

- As a solo Frontend Developer, I spearheaded the enhancement of a Next.js-based back-office system, significantly improving its architecture, maintainability, and user experience. I implemented a containerized development environment, achieved 85% test coverage using Jest and React Testing Library (leading to a 20% reduction in bugs), and optimized state management with React-Query, decreasing data-related code complexity by 30%. Furthermore, I enforced code quality with ESLint, established a robust branch strategy, fine-tuned TypeScript compiling options, and maintained systematic release notes to maximize change history traceability. My key contribution was building a reusable common component library, which drastically improved UI consistency and shortened development time, ultimately boosting the system's overall productivity and performance.

Outsourcing Management

- I successfully delivered three new web pages by effectively coordinating an external vendor. My role encompassed facilitating communication between our internal team and the vendor, meticulous schedule management, and comprehensive project planning, which collectively led to the seamless development of the pages.
