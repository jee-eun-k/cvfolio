With over four years of experience in front-end development and a proven track record of successfully leading complex projects, I bring a unique combination of technical proficiency and leadership capabilities.
Proficient in React.js, Next.js, and a variety of JavaScript libraries, I have created interactive user interfaces and improved performance in challenging environments.
Beyond coding, I have managed vendor collaborations, streamlined processes, and ensured seamless delivery of high-quality results.
My ability to bridge technical development with effective project management allows me to contribute value at every stage of the development lifecycle.
