As part of a project enhancement initiative, we are in the process of transitioning our existing JWT-based authentication system to Keycloak SSO. Although we are still in the early stages of adoption, I wanted to document and share the journey so far.

Our previous system had a simple architecture, communicating 1-to-1 with a single backend server that managed token issuance. However, our decision to shift to a Microservices Architecture (MSA) required a complete re-evaluation of our menu and permission management systems, alongside the adoption of Keycloak SSO.

Early in my tenure, I had already improved the project by managing menu data dynamically from a database. As the project grew and the number of managed pages increased, it became clear to both myself and our backend developer that we needed a more granular access control system. The existing model, which assigned permissions to user groups on a per-page basis, was inefficient. It had a significant limitation: we had to duplicate an entire page just to change a single button, which was not a reusable approach.

Our newly designed system works as follows: After a user logs in via Keycloak, the frontend uses the issued token to request a list of menus and fine-grained permissions from a dedicated authorization server. The response data is then used to create a React Context. On every page render, the user dynamically sees only the menus and components that their permissions allow. This enables a flexible permission system that closely resembles **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**.

Furthermore, since Keycloak centrally handles token expiration and renewal, our frontend's token management logic is significantly simplified. This creates a scalable foundation that will maximize the benefits of SSO when we connect other backend services or new frontend projects in the future.

### Current Challenges and Potential Solutions

Of course, this transition has introduced new challenges.

**1. Validating Dynamic Menu Data**
Our first challenge is: 'How can we trust the validity of the dynamic menu data received from the authorization server?' We currently merge hard-coded default menus (like the dashboard) with the dynamic menus, but we are not yet certain if this is the optimal approach.

As a solution, we are considering implementing **schema-based validation** on the frontend. By using libraries like `Zod` or `Yup`, we can validate at runtime that the API response conforms to our defined schema, thereby preventing rendering errors caused by unexpected data structures.

**2. Decoupling Menu Structure from Directory Structure**
Our second challenge is: 'How can we reduce the overhead of modifying our Next.js directory structure every time the menu hierarchy changes as the project evolves?'

To address this, we are exploring the aggressive use of Next.js's **Dynamic Routing** features. For instance, by implementing a single **Catch-all Route** like `pages/app/[[...slug]].js`, we can handle most application URLs from one file. This page would dynamically interpret the URL `slug`, map it to our authorization data, and render the appropriate layout and components. This approach decouples the menu structure from the file system, creating a flexible architecture where backend menu changes require minimal-to-no frontend code modifications.
